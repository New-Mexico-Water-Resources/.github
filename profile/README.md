# New Mexico Water Resources

This is a software project to move an established set of prototype hydrological remote sensing tools in use ([Application Readiness Level](https://above.nasa.gov/meeting_jan2017/docs/thur/1145_Larson_ASTM3%20EKL%20copy.pdf), or ARL 7) and demand by the state operational water agency for [New Mexico the Office of the State Engineer](https://www.ose.nm.gov/) (NMOSE) into full operations and transition to the partner (ARL 9).

NMOSE has the authority over the appropriation and distribution of all surface and groundwater in New Mexico, which is the only state that is in the top-10 driest and poorest states in the US. The remote sensing water management system enables the State to use remotely sensed data for decision-making across water rights management and agriculture, forest and ecosystem monitoring, and drought response and mobilization. NMOSE accesses a unique 7.3 TB, 30+ year record of Landsat (5, 7, and 8)-based evapotranspiration and evaporative stress data developed and produced specifically for the State, including continuous near real time updates for the State, which are visualized in a dashboard codesigned by our technical team and NMOSE to match NMOSE and downstream NMOSE partner requirements. The data and tools save the State over hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and facilitate a more accurate and precise management of precious water resources.

At the beginning of this project, the technical data system ran on NASA servers accessible only by the NASA technical team, and data are pushed to NMOSE storage and to individual NMOSE users by NASA. This open source software project includes all the code to transfer the technical system entirely to NMOSE, as required by NASA for full transition ARL 9 (Year 1).

This project is a collaboration between [Chapman University](https://www.chapman.edu/) and the [Jet Propulstion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
